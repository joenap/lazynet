You can certainly reinvest profits from an S-corporation into the business or pay out profits from a C-corporation as dividends, but the incentives go different ways.  S-corp earnings are taxed as ordinary income (none of the double-taxation of corporate profits) and S-corps can\'t give out different classes of shares, so there\'s an incentive to distribute the profits out to the shareholders.  C-corp earnings are taxed once at the corporate level and then once as dividend earnings, yet they can have multiple classes of shareholders.

I have been doing Avid tech support for over 10 years (Avid is the industry standard software for editing video/film - although that is being threatened strongly) I have been waiting for this to happen. Was wondering when someone would jump on the idea of providing in-browser editing tools for the &#34;YouTube&#34; crowd. Avid\'s a fool not to embrace this... Anyway, I want to jump in soon with the whole video on the web experience. I hope to update everyone soon over time on what my ideas are... Hope all are well and good luck!","time":1172105665,"type":"comment"}'}

Not having expectations of growing a startup to Facebook, Google or Bebo size you are going to be wasting a VC\'s time. This is no mean feat - you have to be mentally prepared to grow and scale a company like mad and similarly your startup must have proved its case for being able to scale.<p>Whats the best way to know if your startup is ready? build a prototype, get some traction, look at the numbers, measure, experiment then measure again. If you truly are going to scale (and you are growing at 1% a day) and you\'ve experimented enough that you\'ve found a suitable path you\'ll end up needing money of the VC scale.<p>It doesn\'t cost much to sit around and build something. Go and test it - figure out what people want first - change your assumptions and above all PROVE that if you scaled your site it\'d be worth it for investors. You don\'t need VC yet to start something and test it out - If it comes to that point well thats something to think about.<p>I\'m reminded of the story Michael Birch of Bebo tells - they built something, put it out there off the traffic of birthday alarm and experimented with features. Every time a feature added to the growth of the site and got a noticeable increase in users they kept it and tried something else which also contributed to the growth. By experimenting, measuring and then iterating for things which correlated for growth they ended up on the right path. When they had 5 million users and were growing month on month they had the numbers to prove themselves. They took $15m from Benchmark capital. The bottom line - you\'ll know when you are ready: just go prove the numbers. ","time":1172368210,"type":"comment"}'}

I could see something like Hotmail or Skype being bootstrapped with this method, because those services are useful to both individuals and businesses. Back then, email from any PC with the internet or free international voice calls would have been things that many businesses would have paid for (and still would, if there weren\'t so many free alternatives now). Even Reddit got its NYT deal soon after starting which pushed it into the black, did it not? (not rhetorical - I don\'t know much about their history so tell me if I\'m wrong!)<p>There is the problem of loss of focus though. If a company like Hotmail started in \'95, realised it could make millions selling their product to companies and focused on that (sales, turnkey servers for easy installation), they would probably only get a few years of that income at most before they are dethroned by a company that just focused on making the best web based email possible. So it would be a bit of a local maxmimum. Is this more dangerous than the loss of focus of doing something totally unhelpful/unrelated to the main product to bring in some cash (contracting, searching for investors) while simultaneously working on the final product?
